#### Breaking

- SonarQube API update to 7.9 for latest LTS support (9.9)
- Removed `dartanalyzer` implementation that scans each file individual, this may affect projects running on a (pretty) old Dart SDK.
  The replacement runs legacy `dartanalyzer .` instead which is much faster.
- Renamed `sonar.flutter.analyzer.mode` to `sonar.dart.analyzer.mode` and reworked implementation.
  - Available options `DETECT|DART|FLUTTER|MANUAL|DARTANALYZER`
  - Defaults to automatic detection by parsing the `pubspec.yaml`.
  - Uses `flutter analyze` when `environment.flutter` is configured in `pubspec.yaml`.
  - Uses `dart analyze` when `environment.flutter` is NOT configured in `pubspec.yaml`.
  - Allows to be configured for legacy `dartanalyzer` if required (`DARTANALYZER`)
  - Allows to be configured for pre-existing analysis reports (`MANUAL`)
- Renamed `sonar.dart.analysis.useExistingOptions` to `sonar.dart.analyzer.options.override`, now defaults to `true`
- Renamed `sonar.dart.analysis.reportPath` to `sonar.dart.analyzer.report.path` - this is only evaluated when `sonar.dart.analyzer.mode`is set to `MANUAL`
- Added `sonar.dart.analyzer.report.mode` option
  - Available options `DETECT|MACHINE|LEGACY`
  - Defaults to automatic detection by parsing the Dart SDK version and defaults to `--format=machine` for Dart when SDK >= 2.12
  - Can be set to legacy mode when using pre-existing analysis report or an older Dart SDK

#### Experimental

- None.

#### Enhancements

- Add a `pubspec.yaml` sensor which adds the file to SonarQube and allow showing lints for this file

- Added missing dart keywords and corrected some
  - `try`
  - `hide`
  - `show`
  - `late`
  - `of`
  - `continue`
  - `covariant`
  - `out`
  - `do`
  - `dynamic`
  - `native`
- Rules update
- Better rules description
